"""
Acquire SharePoint Online browser-session cookies using Playwright and save them into
storage_state.json (or a custom path), which can be consumed by examples/sharepoint/auth_cookies.py.

Requirements (not installed by the library):
  pip install playwright
  playwright install chromium

Usage:
  SP_SITE_URL="https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/demo" \
  PLAYWRIGHT_STORAGE_STATE="./storage_state.json" \
  HEADLESS=false \
  python examples/sharepoint/auth/capture_cookies_with_playwright.py

Notes:
- The script opens a browser window. Complete the Microsoft login (including MFA) manually.
- After login, return to the terminal and press Enter to persist cookies.
- The resulting storage_state.json can be used by auth_cookies.py.
