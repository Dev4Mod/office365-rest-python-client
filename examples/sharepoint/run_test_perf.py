Diagnosing performance issues

In SharePoint, you can access the information that is sent back to the client in the response header for each file.
The most useful value for diagnosing performance issues is SPRequestDuration, which displays the amount of time
that the request took on the server to be processed. This can help determine if the request is heavy and resource
intensive.
